Android build issue fixer instructions
===================================

Gradle/JDK version issues are common with Android builds.
The error you're experiencing is related to using JDK 21 (version 65)
which isn't compatible with the Gradle version.

To fix this:

1. This project has been configured for Java 11, but you're using Java 21

2. Add this to your local.properties file: 
```
org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11
```
(Or another path to a compatible JDK 11 installation)

3. You may need to create/download Java 11 if you don't have it installed

4. You can also build from command line:
```
# Set JAVA_HOME to point to Java 11
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

5. The output APK will be in: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
